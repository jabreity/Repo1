<h1><b>Git Notes</b></h1>

<h3>Local</h3>
	
	<ul><li>Locally means that things are happening just on my computer.</li>
	<li>Local commits back up to a local repository and others can't acces until we push to a remote</li></ul>

<h3>Remote</h3>

	<ul><li>Remote means your browser commits to an online server</li>
	<li>Remote repositories can be accessed by fellow team members (private repo) or publicly (public repo).</li></ul>

<h2>Local Set Up</h2>

	<ol><li>Open your command line/teminal.</li>
	<li>Use the cd command to navigate to your folder. for example <b>cd desktop/playground</b></li>
	<li>Type in <b>git init.</b> This will set up a repository (repo) for you locally.</li>
	<li>A message like this should pop up: "Initialized empty git repository in dir/filename/stuff/here"</li></ol>
